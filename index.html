    title: "Day 1: A Jesus-Focused Life",
    theme: "We’re more focused on what Jesus has done for us than what we have to do for Him.",
    scripture: "Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. - Philippians 2:9-11",
    prayerFocus: "Pray to shift your focus from your own efforts to fully receiving what Jesus has already done for you, finding freedom and victory in His finished work.",
    reflectionPrompt: "The passage states that we don't change by trying harder, but by looking at Jesus. What specific area are you currently striving in, and how can you intentionally shift your gaze to Jesus and His completed work for transformation and freedom?",
    hopeCarrierAction: "Take 5 minutes to meditate on Philippians 2:9-11, intentionally focusing on Jesus's exaltation and what He has done, rather than on your own efforts.",
},
            {
    title: "Day 2: A Spirit-Filled Life",
    theme: "We walk in the character and power of Jesus, desperate for and dependent upon the Holy Spirit to fill us to overflowing.",
    scripture: "You know how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. - Acts 10:38",
    prayerFocus: "Pray to welcome and invite the Holy Spirit to fill you afresh daily, surrendering every area of your life to His empowering presence, character, and guidance.",
    reflectionPrompt: "Considering that the Holy Spirit makes His home in you and desires to fill you to overflowing, not by force but by invitation, what areas of your life are you currently holding back from His influence, and how can you humbly surrender them to allow His treasure to shine through?",
    hopeCarrierAction: "Take a moment to humbly invite the Holy Spirit to fill you afresh, specifically asking Him to reveal an area where His character or power is needed through you today.",
},
            {
    title: "Day 3: A Life-Giving Life",
    theme: "We’re on mission to receive and release the life of Jesus wherever we go.",
    scripture: "On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. - Revelation 22:2",
    prayerFocus: "Pray to continually choose the 'tree of life,' receiving God's goodness, healing, and wholeness, so you can be a conduit for His life to others.",
    reflectionPrompt: "If you're feasting from the tree of life, the only important question to ask is: 'Is what I’m about to do, say, act, or think going to be life-giving or life-taking?' Reflect on a choice you face today through this lens.",
    hopeCarrierAction: "Before speaking or acting, pause and ask yourself: 'Is this life-giving or life-taking?' Choose to respond in a way that releases God's life.",
},
            {
    title: "Day 4: Unity",
    theme: "We pursue unity with everything we have, knowing our anointing is found in our unity.",
    scripture: "How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity! It is like precious oil poured on the head... For there the Lord bestows his blessing, even life forevermore. - Psalms 133:1-3",
    prayerFocus: "Pray to actively pursue unity by agreeing with God and submitting your individuality for the good of others, experiencing His blessing, peace, and power.",
    reflectionPrompt: "Considering that in God's kingdom there is no 'neutral' ground when it comes to unity – you are either a unifier or a divider – how will you intentionally choose to be a unifier in your interactions today?",
    hopeCarrierAction: "Go first in apologizing or initiate a courageous conversation to bring unity in a relationship.",
},
            {
    title: "Day 5: Give What We Have Received",
    theme: "We have a responsibility to give what we have received; we owe the world what God has done for us.",
    scripture: "Freely you have received; freely give. - Matthew 10:8",
    prayerFocus: "Pray for a generous heart that is eager to release the valuable treasure of God's grace, wisdom, and love that you have received into the lives of others.",
    reflectionPrompt: "The passage states, 'If we're not actually releasing it into the lives of any other people, we haven't fully received it for ourselves yet.' What has God done for you that you need to start actively releasing to others today?",
    hopeCarrierAction: "Ask God to reveal something He's done for you that you now need to begin doing for others, and then take a practical step to share it.",
},
            {
    title: "Day 6: A Family on Mission",
    theme: "We are beloved sons and daughters releasing our Father's kingdom, moving with God to carry hope to the world.",
    scripture: "God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave Him great pleasure. - Ephesians 1:5 (NLT)",
    prayerFocus: "Pray to fully embrace your identity as a beloved child of God, and to be empowered to actively participate in His mission of carrying hope to the world.",
    reflectionPrompt: "The passage states that when we lose our 'why' (God's mission), we lose our way. How can you renew your 'why' today by intentionally giving your life away for God's purposes, rather than accumulating for yourself?",
    hopeCarrierAction: "Have a meaningful conversation with someone today, asking them 'How's your heart?' or 'What's God been saying to you?'",
},
            {
    title: "Day 7: Freedom",
    theme: "We must actively choose to live in the freedom Jesus has already provided, not losing the ground He has given us.",
    scripture: "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. - John 8:36",
    prayerFocus: "Pray for the grace to actively choose and stand firm in the freedom Jesus has already secured for you, releasing any areas where you still feel bound.",
    reflectionPrompt: "The passage highlights the difference between being set free and living free. What 'prison' (e.g., pride, fear, guilt, brokenness) are you currently experiencing, and how can you declare and agree that Jesus is your freedom in that specific area today?",
    hopeCarrierAction: "Take a moment to say aloud, 'Jesus, You are my freedom!' and identify one specific area where you will actively choose to live free today.",
